## ü™ú Basic Steps to Use

### 1. Extract the RAR File

Unpack the `ProRat BackDoor v1.9.rar` file.
(Some times Antivirus blocks this) 
### 2. Launch ProRat

Run `ProRat.exe`. You should see the main UI window 

### 3. Create a Server

- Click "Create" or "Create Server".
- Enter the victim's IP address.
- Set up the connection port (default is usually 5110).
- Customize features (e.g., keylogger, message box, file browser).
- Choose any Icon.
- Click "Create Server" again.


### 4. Send the Server File

You must deliver the server file to the remote system (ethically and with consent). This is usually done via email, USB, etc.
Note: USE ANY CRYPTERS to make it undetectable by Antivirus.

### 5. Connect to Victim (Again, must be ethical!)

- Use the IP and port to connect.
- Once connected, you'll see the remote system online.
- You can now use the available modules in the interface.
